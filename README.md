# Fibonacci
Worked in a team to create a program that uses test-driven development. Created a program that uses three implementations of a function to compute the Fibonacci number at a given position. The three implementations are:

1. A simple iteration. 
  Given a position n, loop through totaling values until you reach the value for the given position.

2. A simple recursion.
  Given a position, compute the value at a position using the expression fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).

3. A memoized recursion.
  Given a position, look up to see if the value has been precomputed and if so return that value. Otherwise, use recursion to compute the value.
